# SOC Practical Experience

This repository documents my hands-on experience as a Junior Security Analyst in a Security Operations Center (SOC), including incident investigation, log analysis, and threat detection.

## Key Projects
- Unauthorized Login Attempt – Incident analysis using SIEM, threat intelligence, and response actions.
- Phishing Attack – Practical lab analysis (upcoming)
- Brute Force Attack – Log investigation and mitigation (upcoming)

All projects are based on TryHackMe labs and practical simulated attack scenarios.
